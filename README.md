# react-tac-toe

Working through the official [React tutorial](https://reactjs.org/tutorial/tutorial.html) to learn React. Intially this is just my code working through the tutorial, but I'll use it to further refine my React skills as a playground. This project is largely for my own purposes, but it may help someone learn React.

## Run

To run this code use `npm start`. You can also build it using `npm run build` and then put the `build` folder on a web server (or use `live-server`).

## Requirements

* Node.js. I installed Node via Homebrew.

## Suggestions

* In VS Code install the *Debugger for Chrome* extension to be able to debug your code
